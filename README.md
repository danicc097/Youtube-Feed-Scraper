# Youtube Feed Scraper
The main motivation is that, among other tools, I often use Youtube to find new music that pops up in my subscriptions page. When I want to focus on this task, having a huge amount of tabs opened and waiting for them to load is not ideal when I simply want to skim through all songs. Tracking them is also difficult, since I access my Youtube feed for this purpose rather sporadically. With ``Youtube Feed Scraper``, it will be possible to never miss new music and listen to all of it faster than ever.

## Development

#### Requirements

📝 `Python +3.8`  
📝 `pip3`  
📝 `PyQt5` (for full PyInstaller support)  
📝 `pipenv` (recommended)  
📝 Packages inside `pipfile`. They will be installed in the virtual environment with `pipenv install`.

To get started:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/danicc097/Youtube-Feed-Scraper.git`
2. Create a virtual environment for the project with `pipenv shell`
2. Install the required packages and corresponding versions with `pipenv install`
3. Run the main program file with `pipenv run python main.py`
4. To distribute using `PyInstaller`, the project can easily be built with `build-windows.ps1` or `build-linux.sh`.
